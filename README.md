A web-oriented C compiler 🍫

---

The goal is to create a toy C compiler running entirely in the browser from scratch.
Also my first foray into compilers, how exciting!

## Steps

1. Create a tree-walking C interpreter ← _currently here_
2. Create a bytecode VM
3. Create a bytecode C compiler for VM of step 2
4. Create a C-to-WASM compiler by adapting compiler of step 3
5. Work on standards compliance, optimization, speed, ecosystem, etc.
